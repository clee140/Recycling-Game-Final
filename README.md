# Recycling-Game-Final-Version

The RecyclingGame is an interactive game where the user will sort ten common waste items into the three types of trash bins (black, blue, and green). The user begins the game with 0 points and will either receive 100 points for correctly sorting the item or lose 100 points for incorrectly sorting the item. The user will then sort the item (displayed in the top-center position of the interface with the corresponding picture to the left of it) by either clicking the black bin, blue bin, or green bin buttons, which is located on the bottom of the interface. If the item is correctly sorted, the user will gain 100 points and the next item will be displayed, which will be sorted by the user. If the item is incorrectly sorted, the user will lose 100 points and will have to sort the item in the correct bin before being able to move on to the next item. This process will continue until the last item that needs to be sorted is reached. Once the last item is correctly sorted, the game will end and an end of game message will be displayed in the console.
